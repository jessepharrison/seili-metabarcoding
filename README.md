# Haver√∂ metabarcoding study

This repository contains material supporting the following publication:

Harrison JP, Chronopoulou P-M, Salonen IS, Jilbert T, Koho KA. (2021) [16S and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding provide congruent information on the responses of sediment communities to eutrophication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.708716/full). Frontiers in Marine Science 8:708716.

The contents include:

- R scripts used for data analysis and package installations (`/rscripts`)
- phyloseq objects including data processed in micca (`/rdata`)
- environmental metadata (`/envdata`)
- a [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity) definition file and container launch script (`/singularity`)
- output files generated by R scripts (`/figures`, `/stats`)

Descriptions of R scripts:

`PCA.R`
Script for environmental metadata PCA

`16S_singularity_datachecks.R` and `18S_singularity_datachecks.R`:
Data analysis scripts for inspecting data pre-processing steps

`16S_singularity.R` and `18S_singularity.R`:
Data analysis scripts generating most output files 

`taxa_summary.R`:
Phyloseq supporting script, originally available [here](https://github.com/joey711/phyloseq/issues/818)

`imagestitch.R`
Script for combining and editing figure files

`extra_RPackages.R`
